# Know Your State Reps

How many people know who their US senators and congressional representatives are? How many know who represents them at the state level as senators and assemblypeople? We designed an app that utilizes the Google Maps API and the Open States API to improve voter knowledge about the people who represent them and legislate on their behalf. 

## tech stack

Know Your State Reps utilizes the Materialize framework for front-end design. AJAX calls are utilized for API requests to both the Google Maps API and the Open States API. jQuery is utilized for DOM-manipulation, returning API results to the client.
